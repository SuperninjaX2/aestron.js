 The code starts by declaring a few variables.
 
 The first is a DOMManipulator object, which is defined as a function that takes one parameter - a string selector.
 
 This selector will be used to identify all the elements in the document that match the given criteria.
 
 Next, the DomManipulator constructor is called, and if the selector argument is a string then an array of all HTMLElement objects will be created.
 
 If the selector argument is an instance of HTMLElement then only those elements will be included in the array.
 
 Otherwise, an error will be thrown stating that the selector cannot be handled this way.
 
 The ‘*addClass()*‘and *removeClass()*
 methods are also defined here.
 
 They both take one parameter - a class name to add or remove from the list of classes applied to all elements within the DOM tree.
 
 These classes can then be accessed using element.classList property on any node in your document (or even globally using document.getElementsByClassName ).
 
 The *toggleClass()* method simply toggles whether or not a given class has been added or removed from an element's classList .
 
 It also returns this .
 
 Finally, *text()* , *html()* , and *on()* methods are also defined here
 
 The code creates an instance of DomManipulator and assigns it to a variable named "this".
 
 Next, the constructor is invoked.
 
 If the selector argument is a string, then the DOM elements contained within the document's querySelectorAll() method are assigned to this.elements.
 
 If the selector argument is an HTMLElement, then this.elements will be an array of that element.
 
 Otherwise, an Error will be thrown.
 Next, *addClass()*, *removeClass()*, toggleClass(), and text() methods are created.
 
 The addClass() method takes a class name as its only parameter and adds it to the class list for all of the DOM elements in this.elements.
 
 The removeClass() method removes a class from
 
 The code starts by declaring two variables: animationName and animationClasses.
 
 The animationName variable will store the name of the animation to be played, while the animationClasses variable will store an array of five different CSS classes that can be used to style individual elements during the animation.
 
 Next, the code checks to see if there is a class named fadeIn listed in the animationClasses variable.
 
 If there is, then all of the elements in the document with a class named fadeIn applied to them will be removed from their current styles and replaced with those from the fadeIn CSS class.
 
 If no class named fadeIn is found in the animationClasses variable, then an error message is displayed and control returns back to where it was before this function was called.
 
 In other words, if you try to call this function without first specifying an appropriate name for your desired animation, nothing will happen (because no animations are defined yet).
 
 The code will remove any class that is associated with the animationName variable from the elements object.
 The code starts by creating a new element called tagName.
 
 This element will hold the data for the tagName attribute.
 
 Next, the code loops through all of the attributes in the document and sets each one of them as an attribute on the newElement element.
 Finally, textContent is set to the value of tagName.
 
 The getCssValue() function is used to get the value of a style property on any object in the document.
 
 In this case, it's getting the computed style for an element that has been created with the
tag.

 The getComputedStyle() function takes an object as its parameter and returns a string containing all of the properties and values that are defined for that object.
 
 In this case, it's returning "border: 1px solid #000;" which is what was set as border property on
 
tags in our example document..

 The code will create a new
 
tag and append it to the current document's tag.

 The code then sets the newly created
tag's attributes to those of the tag, including its display property.

 Finally, the code loops through all of the elements in the document and appends each one to the newly created
tag.

 The code starts by declaring an object called this.elements, which is an array of DOM nodes.
 
 The first node in the elements array is the document’s root element (in other words, the document itself).
 
 Next, the code gets position information for the first node in this.elements—that is, for the document itself.
 
 The code starts by getting position information for the top and left edges of the document’s root element.
 
 Then it uses a while loop to keep track of where each parent node in the while loop’s scope changes (so that it can update position information accordingly).
 
 Finally, using position information from all of these nodes, the code returns a single value that represents its overall position within the document tree.
 
 The code will find all the elements that have a selector attribute that matches the provided string.
 
 The code begins by creating a new DomManipulator object.
 
 This object will be used to manipulate the DOM.
 
 The first thing that the code does is create an array of descendant elements from the current element.
 
 Then, the code uses the flatMap() method to map each descendant element to an Array object.
 
 Finally, the code returns this newly created DomManipulator object.
 
 The next part of the code is responsible for manipulating the DOM.
 
 First, it sets attributes on the new DOM manipulator object using key-value pairs.
 
 Next, it creates a text node or a css string depending on what was specified as textNode in attribute settings.
 Lastly, it sets styles on newElement using either property values or Object entries from style objects if they were provided.
 
 If no style information was provided, then newElement's default styling will be applied instead (which is typically just plain old HTML).
 
 Next, there are two events that are being handled: addEventListener and removeEventListener .
 
 These methods are used to attach and detach event listeners from nodes in the DOM tree respectively.
 
 Finally, children and targetSelector are set for newElement .
 
 child is an optional parameter that specifies which node should be appended to newElement , while
 
 The code creates a new DOM manipulator instance that will be used to merge two or more elements.
 
 The first argument is the selector string that will be used to find the elements to be merged.
 
 Once the selector has been found, the code begins to work its magic by creating a new DOM manipulator instance based on this selector.
 
 This DOM manipulator will then use the flatMap function to map each element found in the selector string onto an Array object.
 After mapping each element, the code checks to see if there are any text nodes contained within these arrays.
 If so, then the text node from each element is extracted and stored within a new Element object.
 Finally, any style properties associated with these text nodes are also stored within this
